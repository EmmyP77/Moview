                    <p>If he thought about it, Briggs (Channing Tatum) might believe that the injuries from his service as an Army Ranger have taken everything 
                        he had and everything he needed. But he does not think about it. Despite his doctor’s warnings that he has some permanent impairment, he's 
                        determined to get back into the Rangers. Service gives him structure, purpose, fellowship, and enough adrenaline to not have to think about 
                        the many things he doesn't want to think about, including how much more there is still to lose.</p>

                    <p>Briggs needs sign-off from an officer to be readmitted to the Rangers, who call themselves “the Army's premier direct-action raid force.” 
                        He has been repeatedly turned down. Finally, an officer says he will authorize Briggs’ reinstatement if he will perform one task, delivering 
                        an Army dog to the funeral of a veteran who served with Briggs. The dog is Lulu, a sweet-faced Belgian Malinois who performed many brave 
                        rescue operations, but who now is so severely traumatized from being in a war zone that no one can go near her. She has sent three people 
                        to the emergency room and been deemed un-salvageable. Until the funeral, she is muzzled and on Prozac. After the funeral, she is scheduled 
                        to be put down.</p>

                    <p>Briggs, who has said he would do anything to get back into the service, does not want to do this. “You’re asking me to take a dog on a plane 
                        to Arizona?” The officer responds, “I’m asking you to drive a Ranger to a funeral.” The dog is too unstable to fly; indeed, Briggs 
                        is warned not to let her near any person or animal. But if Briggs can deliver Lulu with no mistakes and no trouble, he can get the approval 
                        he needs.</p>

                    <p>Of course, there will be mistakes and there will be trouble on the road from Oregon to Arizona by way of Los Angeles. There will also be 
                        connections from the past, both in person and via an extensive, heartfelt, and very detailed notebook kept by Lulu’s Ranger handler.</p>

                    <p>Tatum the actor responds exceptionally well to Tatum the co-director (along with co-screenwriter Reid Carolin, both directing a feature 
                        for the first time). In his previous films, Tatum has mostly relied on his natural all-American charm, a boy-we’d-like-to-have-next-door 
                        combination of confident strength and self-deprecating humor. We have seen him unhappy and under stress but almost always as a character 
                        who keeps those feelings hidden. Here we see his range, with more vulnerability than he has shown on screen before. Briggs tries his utmost 
                        to hide his struggle from everyone, including himself. But Tatum lets us see it, without consideration for movie star vanity.</p>

                    <p>Carolin and Tatum play it safe in some other choices, though, with too many sun flares and postcard-pretty shots of the beautiful western 
                        countryside and some on-the-nose song selections for the soundtrack. We do not need to hear Kenny Rogers singing “The Gambler” again; when 
                        it comes to that song, it is time to fold ‘em. One of the stops on the road trip is in Portland, and the tired jokes about too-twee 
                        Portlandia-ness and Briggs’ efforts to adapt in order to get laid wear thin fast.</p>

                    <p>What we’re there to see is two wounded warriors, one human, one canine, heal each other, and that works well. There are some surprising 
                        detours along the way, with some characters more interesting than the crunchy Portlandians. The always-welcome Jane Adams brings her 
                        delicate sensibility to a character who could easily have been caricatured. Interactions with two other vets also benefit from thoughtful 
                        performances.</p>

                    <p>Both Briggs and Lulu learn that the skills they relied on in the military might need to be un-learned, or at least kept in check. 
                        Lulu knocks down a man in a hotel lobby only because he is wearing Middle Eastern robes. Briggs learns that perhaps you don’t enter 
                        someone’s property the way you enter enemy territory, even if you think your dog might be there. They also learn that those skills 
                        can have some value in a civilian life, as long as Briggs and Lulu learn to think differently about what they are trying to accomplish 
                        with them.</p>

                    <p>“Dog” is uneven in tone and quality but shows promise in the way Tatum and Carolin approach the story with care and heart. It leaves us 
                        optimistic for the future ahead for the wounded warriors and for the people who told their story.</p>
