                    <p>
                        Back in the day, the two big counterculture sci-fi novels were the libertarian-division Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert Heinlein, 
                        which made the word “grok” a thing for many years (not so much anymore; hardly even pops up in crossword puzzles today) and Frank Herbert’s 
                        1965 Dune, a futuristic geopolitical allegory that was anti-corporate, pro-eco-radicalism, and Islamophilic. Why mega-producers and 
                        mega-corporations have been pursuing the ideal film adaptation of this piece of intellectual property for so many decades is a question '
                        beyond the purview of this review, but it’s an interesting one.</p>

                    <p>
                        The new film adaptation of the book, directed by Denis Villeneuve from a script he wrote with Eric Roth and Jon Spaihts, visualizes those 
                        scenes magnificently. As many of you are aware, “Dune” is set in the very distant future, in which humanity has evolved in many scientific 
                        respects and mutated in a lot of spiritual ones. Wherever Earth was, the people in this scenario aren’t on it, and the imperial family of 
                        Atreides is, in a power play we don’t become entirely conversant with for a while, tasked with ruling the desert planet of Arrakis. Which 
                        yields something called “the spice”—that’s crude oil for you eco-allegorists in the audience—and presents multivalent perils for off-worlders 
                        (that’s Westerners for you geo-political allegorists in the audience).</p>

                    <p>
                        To say I have not admired Villeneuve’s prior films is something of an understatement. But I can’t deny that he’s made a more-than-satisfactory 
                        movie of the book. Or, I should say, two-thirds of the book. (The filmmaker says it’s half but I believe my estimate is correct.) The opening 
                        title calls it “Dune Part 1” and while this two-and-a-half hour movie provides a bonafide epic experience, it's not coy about connoting that 
                        there’s more to the story. Herbert’s own vision corresponds to Villeneuve’s own storytelling affinities to the extent that he apparently did 
                        not feel compelled to graft his own ideas to this work. And while Villeneuve has been and likely remains one of the most humorless filmmakers 
                        alive, the novel wasn’t a barrel of laughs either, and it’s salutary that Villeneuve honored the scant light notes in the script, which I 
                        suspect came from Roth.</p>

                    <p>
                        Throughout, the filmmaker, working with amazing technicians including cinematographer Greig Fraser, editor Joe Walker, and production designer 
                        Patrice Vermette, manages to walk the thin line between grandeur and pomposity in between such unabashed thrill-generating sequences as the Gom 
                        Jabbar test, the spice herder rescue, the thopter-in-a-storm nail-biter, and various sandworm encounters and attacks. If you’re not a “Dune” 
                        person these listings sound like gibberish, and you will read other reviews complaining about how hard to follow this is. It’s not, if you pay 
                        attention, and the script does a good job with exposition without making it seem like EXPOSITION. Most of the time, anyway. But, by the same 
                        token, there may not be any reason for you to be interested in “Dune” if you’re not a science-fiction-movie person anyway. The novel’s 
                        influence is huge, particularly with respect to George Lucas. DESERT PLANET, people. The higher mystics in the “Dune” universe have this little 
                        thing they call “The Voice” that eventually became “Jedi Mind Tricks.” And so on.</p>

                    <p>
                        A little while back, complaining about the Warner Media deal that’s going to put “Dune” on streaming at the same time as it plays theaters, 
                        Villeneuve said the movie had been made “as a tribute to the big-screen experience.” At the time, that struck me as a pretty dumb reason to 
                        make a movie. Having seen “Dune,” I understand better what he meant, and I kind of approve. The movie is rife with cinematic allusions, mostly 
                        to pictures in the tradition of High Cinematic Spectacle. There’s “Lawrence of Arabia,” of course, because desert. But there’s also “Apocalypse 
                        Now” in the scene introducing Stellan Skarsgård’s bald-as-an-egg Baron Harkonnen. There’s “2001: A Space Odyssey.” There are even arguable 
                        outliers but undeniable classics such as Hitchcock’s 1957 version of “The Man Who Knew Too Much” and Antonioni’s “Red Desert.” Hans Zimmer’s 
                        let’s-test-those-subwoofers score evokes Christopher Nolan. (His music also nods to Maurice Jarre’s “Lawrence” score and György Ligeti’s 
                        “Atmospheres” from “2001.”) But there are visual echoes of Nolan and of Ridley Scott as well.</p>

                    <p>
                        These will tickle or infuriate certain cinephiles dependent on their immediate mood or general inclination. I thought them diverting. And 
                        they didn’t detract from the movie’s main brief. I’ll always love Lynch’s “Dune,” a severely compromised dream-work that (not surprising given 
                        Lynch’s own inclination) had little use for Herbert’s messaging. But Villeneuve’s movie is “Dune.”</p>
