                <div class="review-text-container">
                    <p>Like a mash-up of an ‘80s family road comedy like “Vacation” and the visions of a tech apocalypse foretold in films like “The Terminator,” 
                        Netflix’s “The Mitchells vs. the Machines” is a lot of nostalgic fun but told in a modern style. It sometimes succumbs to that animated problem 
                        of choosing hyperactivity over all other storytelling options, but it’s also a whip-smart action film, a movie with nearly “Fury Road”-esque 
                        momentum in its asking of the question, “What if the only family that could save the world was as dysfunctional as yours?” Threaded with clever 
                        commentary on our reliance on tech and featuring some incredibly strong design work, this is a pleasant surprise for families looking for 
                        something new this season, and one of the more purely enjoyable Netflix animated films in a while.</p>

                    <p>Once called “Connected” (neither title is great), this Sony Pictures Animation project was a casualty of the pandemic, originally scheduled for 
                        release last fall before a title change and a shuffle off to the King of the Streamers. Directed by Michael Rianda, and written by Rianda and 
                        Jeff Rowe, “The Mitchells vs. The Machines” is produced by Phil Lord & Chris Miller and is unmistakably creatively inspired by their work on 
                        “The Lego Movie” and “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse.” Like the former, it is loaded with jokes and gags with so many visual flights of 
                        fancy happening at any given moment that it takes multiple rewatches to catch them all. The creative influence of “Spider-verse” is even more 
                        essential to this project’s success—just as that Oscar-winning modern animated classic used comic and street art as a visual inspiration, this 
                        project uses viral and YouTube culture not just in its storytelling but in its design. The result is one of the most visually vibrant animated 
                        films since, well, “Spider-verse.”</p>

                    <p>Like a lot of teens, the generation gap between Katie Mitchell (Abbi Jacobson) and her father Rick (Danny McBride) has been widened by 
                        technology. She has a creative spirit that has led to directing viral YouTube videos, most of them starring her chunky pug Monchi in a series 
                        called “Dog Cop”; dad has no idea how to use a computer or smartphone to even watch the videos that have kind of made his daughter a star. 
                        The personality divide between Katie and her dad feels even wider as she’s planning to go off to film school to pursue her dreams, and 
                        he’s of a generation that doesn’t really know how to express his feelings other than through gifts like a perfect screwdriver. In an effort 
                        to unite them one more time before she leaves, Rick decides that the Mitchells—including mom Linda (Maya Rudolph), Katie’s brother Aaron 
                        (Rianda), and Monchi—should drive Katie to school for a last family road trip. It just happens to come on the same day that the machines 
                        take over the world.</p>

                    <p>While the Mitchells are navigating family drama, tech giant Mark Bowman (Eric Andre) introduces the world to the next step in the tech 
                        evolution, a new version of PAL, this universe’s version of the iPhone or iPad. Imagine if your iTechnology like Siri or Alexa was included 
                        in a literal robot helper. It doesn’t go well because the original PAL virtual assistant (playfully voiced by Olivia Colman) resents being 
                        replaced by the new model and so she turns all of the technology on the planet against its human owners, imprisoning them and planning their 
                        replacement. Only the Mitchells survive the robot apocalypse, and only the Mitchells can stop PAL from destroying the human race.</p>

                    <p>Much like on other Lord/Miller projects, the voice cast of “The Mitchells vs. the Machines” is a notable strength. Jacobson doesn’t overplay 
                        'awkward teen,' imbuing Katie with confidence instead of clichés, and McBride similarly takes the 'emotionally reserved dad' role that has 
                        been done to death in family entertainment and makes it heartfelt. There are also incredibly fun vocal performances throughout the supporting 
                        cast, including Fred Armisen & Beck Bennett as a pair of robots who end up allies of the Mitchells, Chrissy Teigen & John Legend as the perfect 
                        parents who live next door, and, believe it or not, Blake Griffin and Conan O’Brien.</p>

                    <p>However, the greatest strength of “The Mitchells vs. the Machines” is its design. A blend of strong character lines that look hand-drawn 
                        give the film the feel almost of a comic book in motion, but the filmmakers have embedded the piece with enough easter eggs for YouTube 
                        culture that it feels like not just a film about Katie but the movie this young film school student would have made herself. It’s constantly 
                        visually inspired and creative, even if it has a tendency to get almost too cluttered, especially in its second half. Still, it’s never once 
                        visually boring, for parents or their more net-savvy children.</p>
