                <div class="review-text-container">
                    <p>Turning Red is a radical, brazenly hormonal PG movie that instantly fills a huge void in the lives of awkward, novel female teens who might 
                        just be starting to crawl out of their childhood cocoons with a disharmony of mystifying awakenings and sexual feelings. That achievement is 
                        perhaps no surprise coming from Pixar, a studio that can always be trusted for a generous dose of reflective, grown-up nostalgia as well as a 
                        good old-fashioned coming-of-age saga. After all, weren’t some of the best characters of the fiercely inventive animation house—from the 
                        talking dolls of the “Toy Story” franchise to the corporeal feelings of “Inside Out,” the rebellious princess of “Brave,” and the aspiring 
                        young musician of “Coco”—gloriously defined by its signature preoccupations? Still, “Turning Red” (which deserves a lot better than the 
                        straight-to-streaming fate Disney has bestowed upon it) feels pioneering and surprising even for the shop behind the groundbreaking animated 
                        sci-fi “WALL-E.” For starters, never before has a Disney female ever been asked, “Has the red peony blossomed?” as an inquiry about the start 
                        of her menstruation.</p>

                    <p>In that regard, “Turning Red” is both a triumphant thematic homecoming for the company and a welcome outlier within the Pixar canon that is, 
                        exceptions aside, typically over-flooded with male-centric narratives. What’s even greater about it is its recognizable foundation carrying 
                        shades of various superhero tales and the likes of “Teen Wolf” (the 1985 one). You know, stories in which boys and men hide behind their 
                        alter-egos while they make sense of the new eyes through which they see the world. Written by Shi and Julia Cho, “Turning Red” passes this 
                        familiar baton to Mei, unearthing something that is both culturally specific and universal through its Chinese-Canadian protagonist clearly 
                        fashioned by the co-scribes with heaps of personal memories and loving insights.</p>

                    <p>It’s certainly a delight to follow Mei once she discovers her inner red panda and figures out that as long as she keeps a cool and collected 
                        demeanor sans emotions with a little help from her friends, the pink brute won’t take over. Who knows, she could perhaps even lead a normal 
                        life and even have some fun along the way. But that’s easier said than done when you’re a teenage girl defined by your wobbly mood swings and 
                        the time you spend with your equally frenzied group of friends. In Mei’s case, her girlhood clan consists of the sharp-tongued Abby (Hyein Park), 
                        nonconformist Miriam (Ava Morse), and the nonchalant Priya (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan). Together, the celebrated quartet swing from one trouble 
                        to the next, trying to do everything they can to see their dreamy boy band 4*Town in concert. (The five-member band does have some actual 
                        bangers in the film, written by Billie Eilish and Finneas O’Connell.) But with Mei’s plush red panda slightly altering their plans, the friends 
                        finds themselves at a crossroads that directly concerns the young Mei’s future.</p>

                    <p>As it turns out, Mei had been cursed with a spell passed on through the generations of women in her family. And it can only be broken if she 
                        willingly participates in a strenuous ritual that would keep her nuisance alter-ego safely tucked away forever. Through this dilemma, Shi 
                        beautifully constructs a traditional tale of generational clash between Mei and her mother, filling their unity and contradictions with 
                        thoughtful details of their urban life: the family temple they run as a tourist attraction, the elaborate, studiously cooked meals, the 
                        domestic support that runs deep within their household. The animation style—infused with traditional motifs, interludes of anime, and a 
                        zippy energy—rises to the occasion, vividly painting Mei’s world with the same level of intricacy Shi and Cho conjure up on the page. While 
                        the film’s slightly bloated finale overpowers some of the leaner moments that come before it, “Turning Red” flickers with a bright feminine 
                        spirit, one that feels new, crimson-deep, and unapologetically rebellious.</p>
