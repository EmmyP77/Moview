# Moview
This is a 2nd-semester HTML5 project.
It is a movie review (Moview) website that was built using HTML, CSS & Javascript (JQuery was used for sliders as well).
The website does not implement forms, so the reviews are to be read (and not commented on) alone.
NOTE: The images were downloaded off of Google, and the reviews were copied.
The website is strictly for demonstration purposes.
